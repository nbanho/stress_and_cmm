# Computer mouse movements indicate work stress

This repository provides data (data.csv) and reproducible code (analysis.rmd) for the study on the relationship between stress and computer mouse movements. To reproduce the results of our analysis, open and run the R Markdown file analysis.rmd. Note that due to privacy concerns, we can only provide the preprocessed data without personal attributes.
